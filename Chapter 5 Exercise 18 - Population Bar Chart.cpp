// Chapter 5 Exercise 18 - Population Bar Chart.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
//Programmer :Brenna Meyer 
//Date: March 20th,2025
//Requirements:Write a program that produces a bar chart showing the population growth of Prairieville, a small town in the Midwest,
// at 20-year intervals during the past 100 years. The program should read in the population figures 
// (rounded to the nearest 1,000 people) for 1900, 1920, 1940, 1960, 1980, and 2000 from a file. For each year, 
// it should display the date and a bar consisting of one asterisk for each 1,000 people. The data can be found in the People.txt file.

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
}
